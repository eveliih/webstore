# WebStore
This is the final project for Full Stack open course. Goal is to build a simple webstore.

Currently this project is on a summer holiday. To be continued in the Autumn 2024. My app and database were running in Azure. I used all my studend credits there to some experiment just before the summer, so I have to find a new home for my app in the Autumn. You can still check my cool code ðŸ˜Ž
