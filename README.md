When you open the app it might take some time to load for the first time since the Always on (billable) feature is not enabled. Please be patient and refresh the page if it does not work for the first time.
[App running here](https://foodonlineapp.azurewebsites.net/)

- Link to an address, where the application is running. If you're creating a mobile application, demo will be scheduled individually.
- Some user instructions and explanation of the purpose of your project (ie. what does it do), or a link to them
- Link to work hours listing. Do it as a .md, pdf, or in some way that is immediately visible (ie. no file download required)
- The time keeping must include the total sum of spent hours
- Time keeping and repository commit history must reasonably match each other. Do intermediate commits!
- If your project is split into several repositories, a link to the other repositories
- Your repository and code base must be presentable. No out-commented or otherwise unused code or such.
