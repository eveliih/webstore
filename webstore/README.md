[App running here](https://onlinefoodapp.azurewebsites.net/)

- Link to an address, where the application is running. If you're creating a mobile application, demo will be scheduled individually.
- Some user instructions and explanation of the purpose of your project (ie. what does it do), or a link to them
- Link to work hours listing. Do it as a .md, pdf, or in some way that is immediately visible (ie. no file download required)
- The time keeping must include the total sum of spent hours
- Time keeping and repository commit history must reasonably match each other. Do intermediate commits!
- If your project is split into several repositories, a link to the other repositories
- Your repository and code base must be presentable. No out-commented or otherwise unused code or such.
